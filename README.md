## Team project for a university lab.
### A C/Python like language created in C. 

The project has 3 different phases so we create a different Branche for each phase   
- Lexical Analyzer
- Parser
- Semantic Analysis

You can run every phase individually.

Every branch has its own makefile to compile the files.
